See [the addon's workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3607870957) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Dpw0VvH4m0) for more information.<br>For any issues with the item (that I don't already know about), please report them here in the Issues tracker.

### Known bugs & TODOs
* Special behavior if player is holding their own defeat sword (can kill anyone with it?)
* Cvar for "death's list" mode (off by default)
* Putting the target's profile pic. on the model or behind the shop icon (if possible)
* Make deploy song loop instead of fading out
* Cosmetic improvements to the PaP effect, making the upgrade message reflect the PAP damage resist. convar & making it play the alternative deploy song
* Bug/Limitation: Target disconnecting mid-round will not change the weapon's name in the shop
* Bug: Deploy song randomly stopping early
* Bug: Deploy song not stopping when it should in some cases when PaP'ing.
* Bug: Randomly swapping models with the crowbar when deploying/holstering either item (note: may not happen on actual servers? TBD)
* Bug: Two deploy songs may play at the same time when PaP'ing if target is last alive
* Minor Bug: Odd stuff happens in local testing when Swapper is last alive target (normally impossible, round ends)
* Minor Bug: Deploy song may restart after it ends when any player dies/respawns
* Bug [wontfix]: PaP'ing sword after the target disconnects sends user the related chat notifcation agai



*What a triumph is that...*
