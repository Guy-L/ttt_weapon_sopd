### Known bugs & TODOs
* Improve animations
* Special behavior if player is holding their own defeat sword (can kill anyone with it?)
* Putting the target's profile pic. on the model or behind the shop icon (if possible)
* Make deploy song loop instead of fading out
* Cosmetic improvements to the PaP effect, making the upgrade message reflect the PAP damage resist convar & making it play the alternative deploy song
* Bug: Deploy song randomly stopping early
* Bug: Deploy song not stopping in some cases when PaP'ing.
* Bug: Randomly swapping models with the crowbar when deploying/holstering
* Bug: Odd stuff happens in testing when Swapper is last alive target (normally impossible, round ends)
* Bug: Two deploy songs may play at the same time when PaP'ing if target is last alive
* Bug: Knife switching thing (double check this)
* Bug: Deploy song may restart after it ends when any player dies/respawns




*What a triumph is that...*
